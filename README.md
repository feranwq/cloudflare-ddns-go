# üöÄ Cloudflare DDNS Go

This project is based on reference [cloudflare-ddns](https://github.com/timothymiller/cloudflare-ddns)

## üß∞ Requirements

- [Cloudflare account](http://nfty.sh/kiUR9)
- [Domain name](http://nfty.sh/qnJji)

[üëâ Click here to buy a domain name](http://nfty.sh/qnJji) and [get a free Cloudflare account](http://nfty.sh/kiUR9).

### Supported Platforms

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (optional)

### Helpful links

- [Cloudflare API token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
- [Cloudflare zone ID](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167836-Where-do-I-find-my-Cloudflare-IP-address-)
- [Cloudflare zone DNS record ID](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019093151-Managing-DNS-records-in-Cloudflare)

## üö¶ Getting Started

First copy the example configuration file into the real one.

```bash
cp config-example.yml config.yml
```

Edit `config.json` and replace the values with your own.

### üîë Authentication methods

You can choose to use either the newer API tokens, or the traditional API keys

To generate a new API tokens, go to your [Cloudflare Profile](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) and create a token capable of **Edit DNS**. Then replace the value in

```json
"authentication":
  "api_token": "Your cloudflare API token, including the capability of **Edit DNS**"
```

Alternatively, you can use the traditional API keys by setting appropriate values for:

```json
"authentication":
  "api_key":
    "api_key": "Your cloudflare API Key",
    "account_email": "The email address you use to sign in to cloudflare",
```

### Enable or disable IPv4 or IPv6

Some ISP provided modems only allow port forwarding over IPv4 or IPv6. In this case, you would want to disable any interface not accessible via port forward.

```json
"a": true,
"aaaa": true
```

### Other values explained

```json
"zone_id": "The ID of the zone that will get the records. From your dashboard click into the zone. Under the overview tab, scroll down and the zone ID is listed in the right rail",
"subdomains": "Array of subdomains you want to update the A & where applicable, AAAA records. IMPORTANT! Only write subdomain name. Do not include the base domain name. (e.g. foo or an empty string to update the base domain)",
"proxied": "Defaults to false. Make it true if you want CDN/SSL benefits from cloudflare. This usually disables SSH)",
"ttl": "Defaults to 60 seconds. Longer TTLs speed up DNS lookups by increasing the chance of cached results, but a longer TTL also means that updates to your records take longer to go into effect. You can choose a TTL between 60 seconds and 1 day. For more information, see [Cloudflare's TTL documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/ttl/)",
```

## üì† Hosting multiple subdomains on the same IP?

You can save yourself some trouble when hosting multiple domains pointing to the same IP address (in the case of Traefik) by defining one A & AAAA record 'ddns.example.com' pointing to the IP of the server that will be updated by this DDNS script. For each subdomain, create a CNAME record pointing to 'ddns.example.com'. Now you don't have to manually modify the script config every time you add a new subdomain to your site!

## üåê Hosting multiple domains (zones) on the same IP?

You can handle ddns for multiple domains (cloudflare zones) using the same docker container by separating your configs inside `config.json` like below:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

Do not include the base domain name in your `subdomains` config. Do not use the [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name).

```bash
{
  "cloudflare": [
    {
      "authentication": {
        "api_token": "api_token_here",
        "api_key": {
          "api_key": "api_key_here",
          "account_email": "your_email_here"
        }
      },
      "zone_id": "your_zone_id_here",
      "subdomains": [
        {
          "name": "",
          "proxied": false
        },
        {
          "name": "remove_or_replace_with_your_subdomain",
          "proxied": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "a": true,
  "aaaa": true,
  "purgeUnknownRecords": false
}
```

## üê≥ Deploy with Docker Compose

Pre-compiled images are available via [the official docker container on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wqferan/cloudflare-ddns).

Modify the host file path of config.json inside the volumes section of docker-compose.yml.

```yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  cloudflare-ddns:
    image: wqferan/cloudflare-ddns:latest
    container_name: cloudflare-ddns
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    network_mode: "host"
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
    volumes:
      - /YOUR/PATH/HERE/config.json:/apps/config.json
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IPv6

Docker requires network_mode be set to host in order to access the IPv6 public address.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running

From the project root directory

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Building from source

Create a config.yml file with your production credentials.

### üíñ Please Note

The optional `docker-build-all.sh` script requires Docker experimental support to be enabled.

Docker Hub has experimental support for multi-architecture builds. Their official blog post specifies easy instructions for building with [Mac and Windows versions of Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/multi-arch/).

1. Choose build platform

- Multi-architecture (experimental) `docker-build-all.sh`

- Linux/amd64 by default `docker-build.sh`

2. Give your bash script permission to execute.

```bash
sudo chmod +x ./docker-build.sh
```

```bash
sudo chmod +x ./docker-build-all.sh
```

3. At project root, run the `docker-build.sh` script.

Recommended for local development

```bash
./docker-build.sh
```

Recommended for production

```bash
./docker-build-all.sh
```

### Run the locally compiled version

```bash
docker run -d wqferan/cloudflare_ddns:latest
```
